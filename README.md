# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is a React application that fetches data from the provided URLs and updates the UI based on the wireframe design.

### Fetch Data:

- Fetch data from the given URLs.
- Display loading status (success or failure) for each dataset.

### Filter Colors:

- Display colored circles based on the fetched data.
- Implement the functionality to hide all circles of the same color and add them to the "Filtered Colors" section.
- Implement the "Clear All" button to remove all filters.
